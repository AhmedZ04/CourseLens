    "description": "This course surveys the varied approaches to healing and experiences of sickness in modern life. It does so by investigating health, healing, and religion philosophically (in the way we think about ourselves), culturally (in the way we live), and existentially (in the way we experience our lives). Much of our discussion focuses on medicine, identity, and ethics primarily because a central factor that orients discussions about each is suffering. How we relieve, come to terms with, and act out our suffering have become the predominant features of modern life in western culture. Specific themes covered are the interconnections among dependence, suffering and identity; and the significance of religion for therapy and palliative care.",

The course will facilitate the movement of participants beyond the veil of surface meanings usually ascribed to physical phenomena of the Cree world, and other worlds within other languages. Critical explorations will highlight the connections between this understanding and common approaches to educational programming for Indigenous languages. A shift in participant awareness and positioning in relation to language learning holds the potential for more complex individual understanding of how Cree and other languages carry the cosmology, ontology, and knowledge system of respective, distinct peoples and cultures. Course objectives will include increased knowledge and related educational praxis with deepened understanding about the integral relationship between a language and the people whose lives and thought are reflected therein.",

This course will be based on didactic understanding of the topics and draw upon examples from the expertise of the instructors. Prerequisites CELL 201 or BIOL 201, 300 level course in CELL or GENET or consent of the Department. Note: Not to be taken by students with credit in CELL 403. In addition, not available to students currently enrolled in CELL 403.",

Students will also participate in a mock peer review committee and make final funding decisions. Enrolment is limited, and registration is by permission of the Department. May not be taken for credit if credit has already been obtained in NEURO 621.",
